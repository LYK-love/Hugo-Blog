# About Me.
## Hi! I'm Nathan. {#Hi}

I'm an 18 y.o tech enthusiast. My hobbies include gaming, video editing, photo manipulation, reading books, socialising with friends and going to the gym. I have a keen interest in computers, computer repair and hardware/software hacking/cybersecurity. I am currently studyin the BTEC Extended Diploma Information Technology at Level 3 in college while persuing apprenticeships for when I leave. In my spare time I like to start projects, such as this Hugo website. I'm currently working two part time jobs, one working at a local bar in my town as a more social experince. While the other job is working for a local shop maintaining and managing the website along with product stocks.
